# ElytraMenu
Adds some helpful features for using an Elytra
i did this just too learn how to create custom GUIs in minecraft
and i thought i would just put this plugin here becoz why not
i dont expect anyone to download it(if u do, what are you?)

TODO:
1. On player death remove dropped item entity and return to player's inventory after respawn
2. Use a custom compass(Custom name, lore) to access the menu, instead of a normal compass(which will no longer be able to access it)
3. Insert the custom compass to the player's inventory upon joining/creating the world for the first time
4. bind the custom compass to the player's 9th hotbar slot(configurable)
5. idk
